## microbit-NRG
A random number generator using the microbit's sensors to generate a lot of numbers.


**How to use**
1) Flash the micro:bit with the hex in the release section.
2) Connect the your micro:bit to a serial terminal (guide to set this up [here](https://www.microbit.co.uk/td/serial-library) [Using echo buffer recommended]).
3) Press B to change the length (this isn't how long the output is just how many times it repeats the sum) and follow the information that it writes to the terminal.
4) Once you have set a length press a to generate a number.
5) Done.
